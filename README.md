# Emerson ROC800 driver written in golang

## Purpose
The purpose of this library is to provide a working example of how the ROC protocol works. This code will likely only support a minimal set of the available Opcodes, likely limited to reading and writing parameters.

## On ROC Plus
I am not terribly familiar with ROC Plus, but it appears mostly to extend the protocol with additional Opcodes. I may or may not extend this library to include ROC Plus functionality.
